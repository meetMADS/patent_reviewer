BACKGROUND
[0002] Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) devices are gaining
10 popularity in mainstream semiconductor applications, such as embedded NonVolatile Memories (NVMs) and in-memory computing, due to their simple
structure, low-voltage operations, and high-speed switching capabilities. Crossbar
array architectures, particularly leveraging memristor networks, are extensively
explored for their potential in efficient computing.
15 [0003] Conventional computing networks based on Von Neumann
architectures are characterized by a bottleneck of spatially separate computing and
memory units, which limits the network performance in terms of speed and power
for large data sets. In contrast, in-memory computing facilitated by the memristor`
crossbar array architectures offers promising benefits in area, energy, and
20 throughput efficiency. Thus, the memristor arrays facilitate applications, including
high-density storage, NVMs, logic computation, and solving complex tasks.
[0004] However, sneak path leakage currents pose serious practical
concerns in the crossbar arrays assembled with the memristors. The sneak paths
through unselected cells can disturb the state of the RRAM device and increase
25 overall power consumption in the arrays. Therefore, to alleviate the sneak path
currents, it is necessary to have a selection device in series with the RRAM devices
for array operations, as illustrated in FIG 1A.
[0005] Among various selector technologies, Silicon (Si)-based selector
devices are of great interest because they can provide high current density and high
30 non-linearity. Moreover, Si-based selectors are simple to fabricate and easily
adjustable to required parameters, making them both device and process
3
compatible. For the RRAM devices, different materials are explored for resistive
switching layers. In many cases, the RRAM devices employ filamentary switching
materials, which inherently introduce a level of stochasticity in device operation.
This inherent variability can significantly impact device reliability and limit the
5 RRAM device's effectiveness for critical memory applications.
[0006] Recent progress has demonstrated the potential of resistive random
access memory (RRAM) in exhibiting analog memory and in-memory computing
capabilities. RRAM devices offers desirable memory characteristics such as nonvolatility, scalability, low variability, high memory window, retention and
10 endurance. Consequently, RRAM emerges as an attractive candidate for integration
into crossbar arrays. However, some of the potential RRAM candidates are
subjected to high temperatures in reactive environment during fabrication process
which makes the integration of RRAM with silicon-based devices challenging. The
high temperature process can adversely impact Si-junctions or the interconnection
15 between silicon device and RRAM. Hence, a robust and compatible method for
integrating high-temperature processed RRAM devices with Si-based selector
devices within standard fabrication process remains necessary.
[0007] Thus, it is desired to address the above-mentioned disadvantages or
other shortcomings or at least provide a useful alternative.
